Because most real endpoints need both:

To verify the user (auth)

To perform a database action (CRUD)


---------

And PrivilegedRoles itself depends on `AccessTokenBearer()` internally through your `role_checker`.

So authentication still happens, but it’s enforced at the decorator level instead of as a parameter.

```json
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "type": "uuid_parsing",
            "loc": [
                "path",
                "ticket_id"
            ],
            "msg": "Input should be a valid UUID, invalid character: expected an optional prefix of urn:uuid: followed by [0-9a-fA-F-], found m at 1",
            "input": "my-tickets",
            "ctx": {
                "error": "invalid character: expected an optional prefix of urn:uuid: followed by [0-9a-fA-F-], found m at 1"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

fix: Reorder routes
```py
# ✅ Define specific routes FIRST
@ticket_router.get(
    "/my-tickets",  # Specific path
    status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK,
    response_model=list[TicketDetails],
    dependencies=[AllUsers],
)
async def get_my_tickets(
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session),
    current_user: dict = Depends(AccessTokenBearer()),
):
    user_id = current_user["user"]["user_id"]
    return await ticket_service.get_user_tickets(user_id, session)


# ✅ Define parameterized routes AFTER
@ticket_router.get(
    "/{ticket_id}",  # Parameterized path
    response_model=TicketDetails,
)
async def get_ticket(
    ticket_id: UUID,
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session),
):
    ...
```

Why This Happens
FastAPI evaluates routes in the order they're defined. When you have:

/{ticket_id} defined first → catches everything, including /my-tickets
/my-tickets defined second → never gets reached

By putting specific literal paths before parameterized ones, FastAPI will match /my-tickets exactly before trying to interpret it as a parameter.
Your service code looks fine—this is purely a routing configuration issue!
